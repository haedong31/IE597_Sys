`Wavelet Transformation

(1) Please read materials covered for wavelet and the review paper on "Wavelet transforms and the ECG: a review"

(2) Please generate stationary and nonstationary sinusoids as in slides #10, #11, then perform FFT and IFFT transformations

(3) Please replicate the CWT results in slide #22

(4) Please replicate the DWT threshold denoising results in slide #52 and #53 (Haar and Coif30)
